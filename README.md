AI-Based Movie Recommendation System
Integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Design & Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)
📖 Overview

This project is a Movie Recommendation System that intelligently suggests movies based on a user’s input — either by movie title or genre.

It integrates DAA concepts like Merge Sort and Searching algorithms with AI techniques like Content-Based Filtering and Heuristic Ranking to provide efficient and smart movie recommendations.

Built using Python (Tkinter GUI, Pandas, and Pillow), this project demonstrates how traditional algorithmic efficiency can enhance modern AI-based decision systems.

🚀 Features

✅ Search by movie title or genre
✅ Display top 5 trending movies (highest rated)
✅ Show movie posters dynamically
✅ Display execution time and algorithm complexity (O(n log n))
✅ Use of Merge Sort for sorting and Search algorithms for finding movies
✅ Simple, interactive Tkinter GUI
✅ Built using AI + DAA integration concepts

🧠 AI Concepts Used
Concept	Description
Content-Based Filtering	Recommends movies similar to user’s input based on genre and attributes.
Rule-Based Reasoning	Uses condition-based logic for filtering results.
Heuristic Ranking	Sorts movies by ratings for best recommendations.
Knowledge Representation	Each movie is represented as an object with attributes (title, genre, year, rating, etc.).
🧩 DAA Concepts Used
Algorithm	Purpose	Time Complexity
Merge Sort	To alphabetically sort movie titles	O(n log n)
Linear Search	To search for movies or genres	O(n)
Genre-Based Filtering	To recommend similar movies	O(n)
